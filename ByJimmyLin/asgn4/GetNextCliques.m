%GETNEXTCLIQUES Find a pair of cliques ready for message passing
%   [i, j] = GETNEXTCLIQUES(P, messages) finds ready cliques in a given
%   clique tree, P, and a matrix of current messages. Returns indices i and j
%   such that clique i is ready to transmit a message to clique j.
%
%   We are doing clique tree message passing, so
%   do not return (i,j) if clique i has already passed a message to clique j.
%
%	 messages is a n x n matrix of passed messages, where messages(i,j)
% 	 represents the message going from clique i to clique j. 
%   This matrix is initialized in CliqueTreeCalibrate as such:
%      MESSAGES = repmat(struct('var', [], 'card', [], 'val', []), N, N);
%
%   If more than one message is ready to be transmitted, return 
%   the pair (i,j) that is numerically smallest. If you use an outer
%   for loop over i and an inner for loop over j, breaking when you find a 
%   ready pair of cliques, you will get the right answer.
%
%   If no such cliques exist, returns i = j = 0.
