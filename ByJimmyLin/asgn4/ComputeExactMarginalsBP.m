%COMPUTEEXACTMARGINALSBP Runs exact inference and returns the marginals
%over all the variables (if isMax == 0) or the max-marginals (if isMax == 1). 
%
%   M = COMPUTEEXACTMARGINALSBP(F, E, isMax) takes a list of factors F,
%   evidence E, and a flag isMax, runs exact inference and returns the
%   final marginals for the variables in the network. If isMax is 1, then
%   it runs exact MAP inference, otherwise exact inference (sum-prod).
%   It returns an array of size equal to the number of variables in the 
%   network where M(i) represents the ith variable and M(i).val represents 
%   the marginals of the ith variable.
