%COMPUTEINITIALPOTENTIALS Sets up the cliques in the clique tree that is
%passed in as a parameter.
%
%   P = COMPUTEINITIALPOTENTIALS(C) Takes the clique tree skeleton C which is a
%   struct with three fields:
%   - nodes: cell array representing the cliques in the tree.
%   - edges: represents the adjacency matrix of the tree.
%   - factorList: represents the list of factors that were used to build
%   the tree. 
%   
%   It returns the standard form of a clique tree P that we will use through 
%   the rest of the assigment. P is struct with two fields:
%   - cliqueList: represents an array of cliques with appropriate factors 
%   from factorList assigned to each clique. Where the .val of each clique
%   is initialized to the initial potential of that clique.
%   - edges: represents the adjacency matrix of the tree.

% YOUR CODE HERE
%
% First, compute an assignment of factors from factorList to cliques. 
% Then use that assignment to initialize the cliques in cliqueList to 
% their initial potentials. 

% C.nodes is a list of cliques.
% So in your code, you should start with: P.cliqueList(i).var = C.nodes{i};
% Print out C to get a better understanding of its structure.
